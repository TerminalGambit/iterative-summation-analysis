# iterative-summation-analysis
out of curiosity, i tried to figure out whether or not there was a parallelism between rows and columns if i applied a progressive summation, m[i][k] = sum(m[i][0] to m[i][k-1])

# explanation for the main.py
so i start by randomly choosing the the base of the matrix then i progressively do the sum. i created a grid class to use tkinter and observe the matrix, it's interactive.
